Hello! I am PhD student in RL Theory at CMAP, École Polytechnique, France, under supervision of Prof. [Éric Moulines](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_XE1LvQAAAAJ).

Additionally, I am researcher at [HDI Lab](https://cs.hse.ru/en/hdilab/) at [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/). I did Master's degree in Computer Science on program "Math of Machine Learning" by HSE University.

My interests include
* Theory of Reinforcement Learning;
* Connection of RL to other ML problems;
* Stochastic Optimization;
