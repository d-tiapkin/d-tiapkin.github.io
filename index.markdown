Hello! I am a PhD student in RL Theory, pursuing double PhD at CMAP, École Polytechnique, and LMO, Université Paris-Saclay under supervision of [Éric Moulines](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_XE1LvQAAAAJ) and [Gilles Stoltz](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/perso/gilles-stoltz/).

Additionally, I was doing research at [HDI Lab](https://cs.hse.ru/en/hdilab/) at [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/). I did my Master's degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science on the program "Math of Machine Learning" by HSE University.

My interests include (but are not limited to) 
* Theory of reinforcement learning;
* Connection of RL to other ML problems (e.g. sampling);
* Stochastic optimization;
