Hello! I am a PhD student in Reinforcement Learning, pursuing double PhD at CMAP, École Polytechnique, and LMO, Université Paris-Saclay under supervision of [Éric Moulines](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_XE1LvQAAAAJ) and [Gilles Stoltz](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/perso/gilles-stoltz/). 

Recently, I was a student-researcher at Google DeepMind Paris, where I studied distillation of language models; check out [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02671) with my results!

Additionally, I was doing research at [HDI Lab](https://cs.hse.ru/en/hdilab/) at [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/). I did my Master's degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science on the program "Math of Machine Learning" by HSE University.

My research interests include
* Reinforcement Learning Theory;
* LLM post-training: RLHF, Distillation;
* Connections between RL and sampling problems;
